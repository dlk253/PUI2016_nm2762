# Assignment 3

## Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:


## 1) Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

### Hypothesis
#### People in the sample that do just diets lose more fat than people in the sample that do just exercise.
##### Diet_Fat_loss > Exercise_Fat_Loss


### NULL HYPOTHESIS: 
#### People in the sample that do just exercise lose more or equal fat than people in the sample that do just diets. 
##### Diet_Fat_loss <= Exercise_Fat_Loss



## 2) Do American trust the president?

### Hypothesis: American believe that Bill Clinton has the honesty and integrity expect in a president and so they trust the president.

#### Poll_Results_Yes > Poll_ Results_NO


### NULL HYPOTHESIS: American do not believe that Bill Clinton has the honesty and integrity  expect in a president and so they do not trust the president.

#### Poll_Results_Yes <= Poll_ Results_NO


## 3) Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.

### Hypothesis: The number of people that quit smoking using nicotine patches is greater than the number of people that quit smoking using placebo nicotine patches.

#### Numb_Quit_Nicotin>Numb_Quit_Placebo_Nicotin


### NULL HYPOTHESIS: The number of people that quit smoking using placebo nicotine patches is greater or equal to the number of people that quit smoking  using nicotine patches.

#### Numb_Quit_Nicotin <= Numb_Quit_Placebo_Nicotin


## 4) Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.

### Hypothesis: Between the age of 1,2,3 and 4 years old, the children of women that smoked during the pregnancy have the IQ lower than the IQ of children of women that didn't smoke during the pregnancy.

#### Smokin_Mother_Children_IQ< Not_Smokin_Mother_Children_IQ

### NULL HYPOTHESIS: Between the age of 1,2,3 and 4 years old,  the children of women that smoked during the pregnancy have the IQ higher or equal to the IQ of children of women that didn't smoke during the pregnancy.

#### #### Smokin_Mother_Children_IQ >= Not_Smokin_Mother_Children_IQ
