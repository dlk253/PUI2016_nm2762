# Review of assignment priyanshi singh (ps3369).

# The IDEA was that A single time user(Customer) will make the most use of the citibike within his timelimit than a subscriber.
# 
# The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
# 
# The mean trip duration of single time user (customer) is less than or equal to the mean trip duration of the subscribers.
# 
# H0 : 
# T(customer) <= T(subscriber)
# 
# The Alternate Hypothesis ($H_a$)
# 
# The mean trip duration of single time user (customer) is more than the mean trip duration of the subscribers.
# 
# $H_a$: 
# T(customer) > T(subscriber)
# 
# 
# THe Significance Threshold:
# 
# Î± = 0.05
The Null iphothesis is well formulated and the data support the test.

The iphothesys is verified as the average trip time of the custumers is around 2000 (I guess seconds as there are no legends about the metric used).

It may be usefull to specify the "timelimit" of a costumer. If we wanted to take the analysis further it would have been intersting to see:

How many of the costumers that use the bike for more of their limitime became subscribers.
